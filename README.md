# vManage Statistics Dashboard
This is the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Statistics Dashboard source code. We are able to collect statistics from Cisco SD-WAN through vManage API's, storing them to an InfluxDB database, and visualising them through Grafana dashboards

Adapted from Eduard Schornig's work at https://github.com/schornig/viptela-sdwan-stats-collector

## Installation

#### Clone the repo
```console
$ git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/gve/vmanage-statistics-dashboard.git
```

### Docker
You must have both of these installed
* Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You may build the docker image from this repo. You may edit [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to change the desired timezone:
```yaml
environment:
      TZ: "Asia/Singapore"
```
A list of valid timezones is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones under _TZ Database Name_


## Setup:
### Credentials
You can deploy this prototype in a lab environment, dCloud instance, or on your own deployment.
You would need to input your details through the [credentials.yaml](stats-collector-code/credentials.yaml) file below.
You need to have your _VMANAGE IP Address, USERNAME, and PASSWORD_. 

```yaml
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Change to your target deployment
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
vManage:
    ip: ip:port    # vManage IP or URL
    desc: lab       # Lab Name (you can put any string in here)
    user: username        # vManage Username
    pass: password            # vManage Password

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Only change if using an external DB
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
influxdb:
    db_ip: influxdb-datasource
    db_port: 8086
    db_name: sdwan
    db_user: root
    db_pass: root
```

### Customisation
You may edit the [measurements.yaml](stats-collector-code/measurements.yaml) to edit the existing measurements
or add your own custom measurements. 

```yaml
AppRouteStatsStatistics:
    active: True
    collect_interval: 60 # How often to collect info
    query_type: AggregateAPICall
    query_data:
      url_endpoint: statistics/approute
      series_name: AppRouteStatsStatistics
      stats_interval: 1440 # How far ago should we collect data
      tags: # Independent Variables in Grafana
        - host_name
        - vdevice_name
        - device_model
        - local_color
        - remote_color
        - name
        - statcycletime
        - entry_time
        - tunnel_color
        - remote_system_ip
      fields: # Dependent Variables in Grafana
        - vqoe_score
        - state
        - tx_octets
        - tx_pkts
        - rx_octets
        - rx_pkts
        - latency
        - loss
        - loss_percentage
        - jitter
```

By default, 8 dashboards will be provisioned during the initial deployment of the Grafana container corresponding to 
7 measurements:

| Dashboard Name            | vManage API Endpoint                                | Frequency   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| DeviceHardwareHealth      | device/hardwarehealth/detail                        | 60 seconds  |
| DeviceSummary             | device                                              | 60 seconds  |
| DeviceInterfaceStatistics | statistics/interface                                | 600 seconds |
| DeviceSystemStatusStats   | data/device/statistics/devicesystemstatusstatistics | 600 seconds |
| AppRouteStatsStatistics   | statistics/approute                                 | 60 seconds  |
| DPIStatistics             | statistics/dpi                                      | 60 seconds  |
| SLA Violations            | event                                               | 60 seconds  |
| Application Statistics    | _correlates AppRoute and DPI Statistics_            | 60 seconds  |

The Application Statistics Dashboard is a special dashboard that correlates AppRoute and DPI statistics
to provide Latency, Jitter, and Loss stats for applications. You may find the relevant code in Line 224 of
[viptela-collector.py](stats-collector-code/viptela-collector.py)

## Usage:

### Docker
Launch all docker containers through the docker-compose file.
```commandline
$ docker-compose up
```

Navigate to the Grafana dashboard in your web browser.
```
http://localhost:3000
```
